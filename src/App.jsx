      <h2>Hello There! üëã</h2>
      <p>
        Thank you for using this tool to filter builds on Jenkins. I hope it
        makes your workflow smoother and more efficient.
      </p>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        Jenkins Genie is designed to help you easily filter your Jenkins builds
        based on Branch, User, Status or Date values directly within the
        webpage, making it easier to find the information you need.
      </p>

      <h3>How to Use</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Navigate to the URL that matches the pattern:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <code>https://*.runwayci.com/job/*/</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              <code>https://*.runwayci.com/view/Automation/job/*/</code>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          The extension will automatically inject the filtering tool into the
          webpage.
